# Electromagnetic-Wave-Inside-a-Transmission-Line
#in this project the user can choose either the load of the transmission line will be a coil or a transsistor.
#after coosing the load the user will need to decide the length of the line, the source ressistor, the coil and where on the line he wants #to see the voltage and current depend on the time.
#at the end the user gets a graph of both the current and voltage.
#this project was written in labview-CVI in C language.
